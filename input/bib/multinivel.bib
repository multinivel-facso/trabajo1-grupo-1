  abstract = {With the rapid technological advancements, schools and teachers have great responsibilities to educate students with regard to technological transformations. Students' ease of access to information and communications technology (ICT) tools provides ample opportunities for the development of these skills, not solely limited to schools. On the other hand, it is known that schools invest efforts to contribute to this process through their updated curricula. Studies on the development of ICT skills show that teachers' behavioral patterns also contribute to students' learning. In the current study, the effect of teacher and student characteristics on students' achievement regarding digital skills was examined together. Within the scope of the research, the characteristics of students and teachers were analyzed through two-level analysis with the data obtained from samples of the prominent countries---Finland and Korea---participating to the International Computer and Information Literacy Study. The analysis regarding the countries involved six models addressing teacher and student characteristics in different contexts. Demographic features, ICT usage purposes and affective characteristics related to ICT were added to the models related to teacher and student characteristics in sets. While gender, computer experience, socio-economic background and general ICT self-efficacy variables came to the fore at the student level, the adequacy of resources were more prominent at teacher level. Discussions were made on the results of the relevant variables in the study.},

La pregunta es problem{\'a}tica porque es dif{\'i}cil hablar de las TIC en general. Si bien las tecnolog{\'i}as llamadas de la informaci{\'o}n y comunicaci{\'o}n tienen en com{\'u}n la manipulaci{\'o}n y comunicaci{\'o}n de informaci{\'o}n en formato digital, sus aplicaciones, funciones y caracter{\'i}sticas son muy diversas. Por otra parte, las TIC son instrumentos, y como tales, pueden ser usados de muy distintas formas. Como se{\~n}ala Mc Farlane et.al. (2002), El problema es an{\'a}logo al de preguntar si los libros est{\'a}n teniendo un impacto en el aprendizaje: los libros son un medio para transmitir informaci{\'o}n, cubren un vasto rango de contenidos, estructuras y g{\'e}neros, y pueden ser usados de infinitas maneras. En este sentido, la investigaci{\'o}n actual ha permitido separar la pregunta general por el impacto de las TIC en los aprendizajes, en al menos tres preguntas o dimensiones m{\'a}s espec{\'i}ficas: Tipos de uso de las TIC e impacto en los aprendizajes, vinculado a las diversas posibilidades de uso asociados a las caracter{\'i}sticas espec{\'i}ficas de las distintas aplicaciones TIC. Condiciones de uso de las TIC e impacto en los aprendizajes, asociado a las caracter{\'i}sticas del colegio como entorno de uso de las TIC. Qui{\'e}n usa las TIC e impacto en sus aprendizajes, vinculado a las caracter{\'i}sticas personales y socioculturales del estudiante. El presente trabajo se organiza de acuerdo a estas tres dimensiones y luego incluye una secci{\'o}n de conclusiones generales y nuevas l{\'i}neas de investigaci{\'o}n.

  abstract = {The increasing relevance of information and communication technologies (ICT) and society's transition towards an information or knowledge society have led to the emergence of new challenges for schools and school systems. Thus, the need for students to develop new forms of skills like digital literacy or computer and information literacy (CIL) is constantly gaining in importance. In the IEA's (International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement) ICILS~2013 (International Computer and Information Literacy Study), the aforementioned competencies were investigated---along with CIL learning contexts and outcomes (such as school-level factors in different education systems)---for the first time for secondary schools by applying computer-based student tests. The research presented in this paper focuses on the school-level factors that support or hinder the use of ICT by teaching staff and students' CIL, drawing in the process on information obtained through school and teacher questionnaires. A multilevel approach was chosen for this research, drawing on representative data from four of the countries which participated in ICILS~2013, namely Australia, Germany, Norway and the Czech Republic. The results show that the relevance of school-level determinants for the use of ICT by teaching staff in schools differs between education systems. Only in Germany, for example, does pedagogical IT support seem to be crucial for the use of ICT in teaching. In the Czech Republic, the self-efficacy of teaching staff plays a key role, whereas in Australia, the participation of teaching staff in professional development activities can be identified as relevant for students' acquisition of CIL. The results also show a statistically significant correlation between the teachers' use of ICT in schools and students' CIL for Germany, yet indicate no significant effects for Australia, Norway and the Czech Republic. In addition to these and the more specific findings for the considered countries, the international comparison presented in this paper reveals both strengths and developmental potential for the selected education systems.},

We have observed converging literacies which have gained new relevance in digital environments, and proposed a definition of digital literacy which focuses on the processes of using digital tools to support the achievement of goals in the individual's life-situation. A suite of online tools is being developed to enable digital literacy progress to be tracked by teachers and learners, and evolution of these tools will continue beyond the life of the project.}

  abstract = {In the arena of software engineering, Project Based Learning (PBL) is one of the fundamental components of practical based assessment. PBL involves team formation where necessary skills are needed to execute the project. Traditionally, the teams were randomly allocated based on individual preferences. To cab on this issue, preference based model needs few refinements such as skills needs to be identified by the facilitator while the students provide the necessary skill data. This way, students get assigned based on their skill rather than just random allocation. In a worst case scenario for random allocation, a team can end up with a very strong team having high skills or vice versa where a team has all of its members with limited skill or few skills are missing. The group created by skill preference would allow each group to more or less have the same strength and nearly all skills would be present in a group. In this paper, a method is extended from its original to cater for other state-of-the-art optimization techniques rather than just genetic algorithm to find a method that can suit small or large dataset. The objective function takes into account the differences between the total skill set of each group with the average total skill set needed for each group and the missing skill penalty of each group is added. Missing skill penalty is incurred due to not satisfying all the constraints such as non-presence of all the skills in a group. The skill rating allows better selection of members in a software engineering course. The results discussed in this paper are from 5 courses of one university.},

  abstract = {Megacities have frequently received a disproportionate amount of attention over other sizes of cities in recent discourse on urban sustainability. In this article, the authors argue that a focus on smaller and medium-sized cities is crucial to achieving substantial progress towards more sustainable urban development, not only because they are home to at least a quarter of the world's population but because they also offer great potential for sustainable transformations. In principle, their size allows for flexibility in terms of urban expansion, adoption of ``green'' travel modes, and environmental protection. At the same time, smaller and medium-sized cities often have fewer resources to implement new transport measures and can be more vulnerable to fluctuations in the world economy. This article critically reviews the potential role and impact of nine commonly considered options for sustainable urban transport in cities in developing countries: (1) road infrastructure;  (2) rail-based public transport; (3) road-based public transport; (4) support for non-motorized travel modes; (5) technological solutions; (6) awareness-raising campaigns; (7) pricing mechanisms; (8) vehicle access restrictions; and (9) control of land-uses. Drawing on international research and examples of policies to reduce the environmental impacts of transport in urban areas, this article identifies some key lessons for sustainable urban transport in smaller and medium-sized cities in developing countries. These lessons are certainly not always identical to those for megacities in the global south.},

It focuses on the introduction of mLearning at a University in the Pacific islands, which developed a fit-for-purpose mobile-learning infrastructure that primarily utilized the short message service (SMS). The university hosts an in-house setup open source SMS gateway that facilitates its custom-made SMS services. The SMS services developed serve the purpose for notifying students with important course information, exam timetable information, course mark information, and library book due dates, and students could also attempt quizzes in their courses via SMS.
